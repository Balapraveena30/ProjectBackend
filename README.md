## Project - IQAC Monthly Report

## Introduction
The Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) is a crucial initiative aimed at fostering a culture of excellence in all operational aspects of the institution. By focusing on continuous improvement, IQAC strives to institutionalize quality benchmarks, promote innovation, and enhance overall academic and administrative performance.

This project is to develop an application to enhance the activities of the institution. The application facilitates seamless management of data and operations through a user-friendly interface. Data is stored securely in the database via dynamic forms, enabling efficient tracking and reporting of institutional activities.

Each section is equipped with a dedicated form to ensure accurate record-keeping and efficient management of all activities, contributing to improved reporting and data management for IQAC.

This repository contains the backend code for the IQAC Monthly Report project. The frontend code for this project is hosted in a separate repository. You can find it here:
